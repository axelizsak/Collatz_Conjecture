## Introduction 📖

The Collatz sequence, also known as the 3n+1 sequence, is a series of numbers generated by repeatedly applying the Collatz rule. Starting with a positive integer, if the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The sequence continues until it reaches 1. 🔄

This program allows you to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer and performs various checks on the sequence to validate specific criteria. ✅

## Features ⚡️

- Generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.
- Performs the following checks on the generated sequence:
  - **Criterion 1** (🔍): Verifies that the difference between the first binary value and its decimal equivalent is zero.
  - **Criterion 2** (🔍): Checks if the difference between the last binary value and its decimal equivalent minus one is zero.
  - **Criterion 3** (🔍): Validates that all values in the sequence are valid binary numbers (containing only '0' and '1').
  - **Criterion 4** (🔍): Verifies the difference between binary values converted to decimal based on whether they are even or odd.
- Provides informative error messages for invalid input or conversion failures.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/izCRV/Collatz_Conjecture
   ```

## Usage 🚀

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Build and run the program using the Cargo command:

   ```shell
   cargo run
   ```

3. Enter a positive integer when prompted.
4. The program will display the generated Collatz sequence and perform the checks on the sequence.
